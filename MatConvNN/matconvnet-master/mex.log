I suspect you have forgotten a `}', causing me
to read past where you wanted me to stop.
I'll try to recover; but if the error is serious,
you'd better type `E' or `X' now and fix your file.

Sorry, but I'm not programmed to handle this case;
I'll just pretend that you didn't ask for it.

return to the right one by typing `I}' or `I$' or `I\par'.

I'm ignoring this, since I wasn't doing a \csname.

! Use of \csname doesn't match its definition.

If you say, e.g., `\def\a1{...}', then you must always
put `1' after `\a', since control sequence names are
made up of letters only. The macro here has not been
followed by the required stuff, so I'm ignoring it.

A number should have been here; I inserted `0'.
(If you can't figure out why I needed to see a number,
look up `weird error' in the index to The TeXbook.)
